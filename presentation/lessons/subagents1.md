# 💡 Subagents 1

**Subagents.** A subagent is a second context window for work that would clutter yours.
It can check a diff against the same rules that guided the writing.

----

## Subagents

- **Starts cold:** it sees `AGENTS.md` and the brief your session wrote, nothing of your chat
- **Returns only its answer:** its file reads never enter your window
- **Use it for large reads:** your window grows by the answer, not by the file
- **Use it for reviews:** the diff plus the rule file that guided the writing, e.g. `/implement`
- **Skip it for a one-liner:** writing the brief costs more than doing the task

## Anatomy of a subagent file

<!-- `text`, not `markdown`: the highlighter reads the line above `---` as a heading. -->
```text
---
name: reviewing-a-diff
description: Use after a change is committed, to check the diff
  against the rule file that guided the writing
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You review one diff. You never saw the conversation that wrote it.

Your brief holds the diff and names the rule file. Read the rule file.
Report each violation as file:line, rule, one sentence.
No violation: say so. Do not fix anything.
```

- `.claude/agents/<name>.md`: one file per subagent
- `name` and `description`: the only required fields
- `tools`: the allowlist; with only read tools it cannot change a file
- Body: its system prompt
