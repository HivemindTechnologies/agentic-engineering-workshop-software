# 💡 Context 1

**Context Engineering.** You cannot change the weights, only what the model reads.
Rules in `AGENTS.md`, procedures in skills, requests as goal, constraints, acceptance.

## What fills a context window

## Loading is not obeying

Where a rule lives, from most to least skippable:

1. **Prompt**: what you type, this conversation only
2. **Skill**: when the description matches
3. **`AGENTS.md`**: every turn, still advice
4. **Script**: enforced when someone remembers to run it
5. **Hook**: fires by itself, skippable with a flag
6. **CI**: the repository refuses the merge

1–3 advice. 4–5 enforced, but skippable. 6 needs a review to skip.

## Context rot

- Stale text in the window lowers answer quality
- Symptoms: forgotten decisions, repeated file reads, loops
- `/context` shows what fills the window
- Next task unrelated: `/clear`
- Same task, window full: `/compact focus on the import bug`

## Code is context
