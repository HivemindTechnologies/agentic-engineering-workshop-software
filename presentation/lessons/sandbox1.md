# 💡 Sandbox 1

**Sandboxing.** The agent reads untrusted text and runs commands in one loop.
A sandbox bounds what those commands reach. This can be: files, network, environment.

## Injection, then exfiltration

- Untrusted text carries instructions
- Read secret → hide it in a URL, a commit, a PR → out
- It needs both: **secret in reach** + **a way out**

----

## Write access alone

- Your `~/.kube/config` in reach: `kubectl delete` runs against the cluster
- Your `~/.aws` in reach: the agent acts as you on the whole account
- Destroy or alter, through the endpoint the work already uses
- **A write credential in reach is already the damage**

----

## Ways to sandbox

- **Claude Code's `/sandbox`**: built in, bounds Bash only; `Read` and `Edit` go through permissions
- **Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`)**: each agent in its own small VM; network rules set per machine, extended per sandbox
- **A process wrapper (nono)**: the kernel bounds one command and everything it starts

We use nono: it wraps the workflow you already have, and its whole config is one file you diff and commit.

## Why this comes first

- 93 % of permission prompts get approved
- Claude Code's built-in OS sandbox removed 84 % of them
- Red team: 24 of 25 credential-theft attempts worked
- Only egress and filesystem limits stopped them

**From here on, no agent runs unsandboxed, the facilitator's included.**

----

## Inside the wall: approvals

nono decides what it can reach. The permission mode decides who approves.

| mode | who approves |
| --- | --- |
| `manual` | you, every action |
| `acceptEdits` | you, commands only |
| `plan` | you, the plan first |
| `auto` | a classifier |
| `dontAsk` | your `allow` rules |
| `bypassPermissions` | nobody |

`Shift+Tab` cycles. The status bar shows the mode.

## 🛠️ Sandbox 1

Three paths out: files, network, environment. Which does nono close?

1. `nix develop`
2. `export SECRET_TOKEN=fake-token`: a fake token in your shell
3. `just sandbox`: read `~/.ssh`, print `$SECRET_TOKEN`, `curl https://google.de`
4. `just strict=true sandbox`: the same three
5. `just claude`: ask it to check the token in your environment. Where did the token go?
6. `nono.json`: add `deny_vars`, repeat step 5
7. `Shift+Tab`: cycle the modes. What changes?
